# Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nano-degree - Arcade Project

## Description
A simple replica/variation of the classic Frogger Arcade game.

## Goals / How to Win
You win by navigating your character across the map without colliding with any of the enemy bugs.

## Scoring & Leveling Up
Each time you successfully navigate across the map you will level up and you will be *awarded* 10 points. However, beware, because each time you level up the game will become more difficult by adding more enemies in your path.  Also, anytime you collide with an enemy, you will *lose* 1 point. Be Careful!

## How to Play
You will use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your character around on the map. You can move in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
